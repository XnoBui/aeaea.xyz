# 3D Model Viewer Lighting Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the lighting system in the 3D model viewer to address the issue of the model appearing too dark. The improvements focus on creating realistic, high-quality lighting that properly illuminates the SOMA character model.

## Problem
The original 3D model was too dark and poorly lit, making it difficult to see details and reducing the overall visual quality of the viewer.

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive lighting system with multiple light sources and enhanced rendering settings.

## Technical Changes

### Lighting System Enhancements

#### 1. Ambient Lighting
- **Before**: `AmbientLight(0x404040, 0.6)`
- **After**: `AmbientLight(0x404040, 1.2)`
- **Impact**: Doubled base illumination for better overall visibility

#### 2. Main Directional Light (Key Light)
- **Before**: `DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 1.0)`
- **After**: `DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 2.5)`
- **Shadow Quality**: Upgraded from 2048x2048 to 4096x4096
- **Impact**: Primary light source now 2.5x brighter with higher quality shadows

#### 3. Fill Light (NEW)
- **Added**: `DirectionalLight(0x87ceeb, 1.5)`
- **Position**: (-10, 10, -5)
- **Impact**: Provides balanced illumination from opposite side to reduce harsh shadows

#### 4. Rim Light (Enhanced)
- **Before**: `DirectionalLight(0x00ffff, 0.3)`
- **After**: `DirectionalLight(0x00ffff, 1.0)`
- **Impact**: Better edge definition and model separation from background

#### 5. Interactive Point Light (Enhanced)
- **Before**: `PointLight(0x00ffff, 0.8, 100)`
- **After**: `PointLight(0x00ffff, 1.5, 50)`
- **Features**: Follows mouse movement, casts shadows
- **Impact**: Dynamic lighting interaction for better engagement

#### 6. Accent Lighting (NEW)
- **Spot Light 1**: `SpotLight(0xffffff, 1.8, 30, π/6, 0.3)`
- **Spot Light 2**: `SpotLight(0x4169e1, 1.2, 25, π/8, 0.4)`
- **Impact**: Focused lighting for better model definition and depth

#### 7. Hemisphere Light (NEW)
- **Added**: `HemisphereLight(0x87ceeb, 0x362d1d, 0.8)`
- **Impact**: Natural environmental lighting simulation

### Renderer Improvements

#### Tone Mapping
- **Before**: `toneMappingExposure = 1.2`
- **After**: `toneMappingExposure = 1.8`
- **Impact**: 50% brighter overall appearance

#### Performance Enhancements
- **Added**: `powerPreference: "high-performance"`
- **Added**: `physicallyCorrectLights = true`
- **Added**: `setPixelRatio(Math.min(devicePixelRatio, 2))`

### Material Enhancements

#### PBR Material Properties
- Enhanced metalness and roughness values
- Improved environment map intensity (1.5x)
- Better normal map scaling (1.2x)
- Proper color space handling for textures

#### Material Conversion
- Automatic conversion of basic materials (Lambert/Phong) to Standard materials
- Better lighting response and realism

## Results

### Visual Improvements
- ✅ Model is now properly illuminated and clearly visible
- ✅ Realistic lighting with proper shadows and highlights
- ✅ Enhanced detail visibility and surface definition
- ✅ Dynamic interactive lighting effects
- ✅ Professional-quality rendering

### Performance
- ✅ Optimized shadow mapping
- ✅ Efficient light setup
- ✅ Smooth interactive lighting

## Usage
The enhanced lighting system automatically applies when the 3D model viewer loads. Users can interact with the dynamic lighting by moving their mouse around the viewport.
